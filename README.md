# configu.js
## Welcome
Welcome to the world of configu.js!
This is where you can find my configu open source javascript modules such as nullbyte.
This repository was created so that **you** can create modded versions of our modules and the generator itself.
I will have a tutorial listed on my website so that you can create mods easily!
I'd still recommend learning javascript, though.
## List of things you can do with configu
- Create webpages without programming knowledge (specifically homepage, but webpages if you're gonna use the same style it generates)
- Create modules with a bit of typing
- Use it for getting a headstart on your projects
- And so on!
## Your choice, not mine
I do not choose what you can or can't do (exceptions are malware), it's your creativity, not mine!
I will gladly accept any changes if I can do them, of course.
Suggestions are always nice to have, sometimes even criticism! I find it funny when someone doesn't like my projects because they couldn't figure the simplest thing out.
## A few things to note
- No, I will not instantly accept suggestions, I'd have to first test them out in a safe environment in case I suspect malicious code. And wack timezones...
- Yes, you can use my project as a template for your project, it's open source. However you cannot say that it's the real and/or original configu.
- No, your mod will not always be instantly put up or changes be applied, it takes time to code and recode it in.
- Yes, chances of rejection exist but are not likely to happen unless it's some form of malicious or hard to implement code.
- Yes, you will have to email me for suggestions (certie@proton.me)
- If you want to humiliate yourself, you can choose for your suggestion to be public (or if it was rejected)
## Thank you for using configu.js
I thank you very much for using configu.js for your projects, and I hope to keep this project up to date!
You only get configu through here, no other way around, sadly :c
## Important info
configu was written during the newer node versions (22.9.0), so I recommend getting that version.
You will need to get nullbyte.js for the NullByte System format
